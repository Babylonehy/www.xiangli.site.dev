    >  We propose a simple circle representation for medical object detection and introduce CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework. Compared with the conventional bounding box representation, the proposed bounding circle representation innovates in three-fold:

    > (1) it is optimized for ball-shaped biomedical objects;

    > (2) The circle representation reduced the degree of freedom compared with box representation;

    > (3) It is naturally more rotation invariant. When detecting glomeruli and nuclei on pathological images, the proposed circle representation achieved superior detection performance and be more rotation-invariant, compared with the bounding box.
